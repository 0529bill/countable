## history

=> used it to change url
(remember to also update it into Router)

=> use Router instead of BrowserRouter becuause BrowserRouter will ignore 'history', because it will handle for you!

## make the website to refresh whenever user click on the signIn/signOut button

=> make a fake action and changes it everytime when user clicked on the button!

## modal

=> using modals + portals (second html file) to prevent the problem of css overlay issues!
